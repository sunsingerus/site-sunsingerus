<h5>Introduction</h5>
<code>git stash</code> stashes changes made in working copy. <br />
Imagine we are in the middle of the way through our code change and are not ready to commit into repo (say, not all modifications completed), but you need to switch and to work on something else. It would be handy to stash changes, finish with this "something else", and return back to unfinished work, stashed earlier.

Initial position. We have changes in working copy (2 modified files and one new):
<pre>
git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   list.php
	modified:   main.php

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	store.php

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</pre>

<h5>Examples</h5>
<h5>Stash changes</h5>
<pre>
git stash
Saved working directory and index state WIP on master: cbd4a32 files
HEAD is now at cbd4a32 files
</pre>

And review the situation
<pre>
git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	store.php

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</pre>
Important: <strong>modified</strong> files are rolled back to <strong>unchanged</strong> position, while <strong>new file is still in place</strong>, untouched.

<h5>List all stashes</h5>
<pre>
git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on master: cbd4a32 files
stash@{1}: WIP on master: cbd4a32 files
</pre>
We have two stashes saved

<h5>Apply latest stash</h5>
<pre>
git stash apply
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   store.php
</pre>
<code>git</code> reports current status - we can see that we have new file <code>store.php</code> added
<strong>IMPORTANT</strong> <code>git stash apply</code> makes no changes to stash list
<pre>
git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on master: cbd4a32 files
stash@{1}: WIP on master: cbd4a32 files
</pre>
We still have <strong>two</strong> stashes

<h5>Pop latest stash</h5>
In case we'd like to extract latest stash (in most cases it is so)
<pre>
git stash pop
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   store.php

Dropped refs/stash@{0} (ebac5ee87b4b8904bd1249763cdc03e0177f5e1f)
</pre>
Take a look on <code>Dropped refs/stash@{0} (ebac5ee87b4b8904bd1249763cdc03e0177f5e1f)</code> line. And we have one stash available now
<pre>
git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on master: cbd4a32 files
</pre>

<h5>Address specific stash</h5>
We can address to the specific stash in commands like <code>apply</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>drop</code> by name, which is listed as the first column in <code>git stash list</code> command and has the form of <code>stash@{0}</code>
<pre>
git stash apply stash@{0}
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   store.php

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   list.php
	modified:   main.php
</pre>

<h5>Clar all stashes</h5>
<pre>
git stash clear
</pre>
